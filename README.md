 Collection of various binary exploitation and reverse engineering challenges (crackmes) alongside a walkthrough.

If the precompiles binaries don't work for you, I v included a Makefile for each challenge that can compile the source code.

But don't peek at the source code if you want to practice your reverse engineering skills!
